# Home Assistant Add-on: AWNET

Local access between Ambient Weather weatherstation and Home Assistant.

## About

You can use this add-on to take advantage of the new "Custom Server" feature in AWNET available in Firware [4.2.8](https://ambientweather.com/support) on the WS-2902A, WS-2902B, WS-2902C, WS-2000 And WS-5000.  I have tested this using my WS-2902B.  It presents a webserver that will accept the polling from the WS device.  It then creates a entity in Home Assistant.

I will be working on a cleaner integration...but it works.
